# PokemonDB_MVC
MVC Aspect of Pokedex Website. 
Connects to API to retrieve data about the original 151 Pok√©mon.
Features Add/Edit/Remove functionality for the database table for the Hall of Fame/Trainers section.
Please note the connection string needs to be updated which I am working on. For now, the online version which can be found on my personal website provides the same functionality.

The database files for both the MVC and API have also been uploaded in their respective repositories.
It is also possible to recreate these databases on another device in order to create an alternative connection string.
